        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with the burrito, my first step was checking to make sure that I have all of the ingredients (when I was making mine, I did not have beans, so an extra store run had to be made, whoops). Once I are sure that I have everything, I mixed the ingredients from the chili powder down into one mixture my mom calls "Taco Mix." Next, I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces, and stuck them on a pan on the stove. I cooked the chicken a little, to ge some of the juices out, and then I added the mix. While the chicken was cooking, I got started on the black beans and rice, placing them on different sections of the stovetop to make sure they all finish around the same time. Since the beans are in a can, it was mostly stirring to prepare it for eating, and the rice was similar, just after already boiling water to place the rice in. Once the three were cooked to my preferred quality, I turned off the flames and got out a tortilla (mine were small so I used 2), and started scooping a balance of the three onto the tortilla(s). Next, I added the other ingredients on top of the warm foods, allowing some melt for the cheese, and wrapped it all up to be enjoyed.</p>
