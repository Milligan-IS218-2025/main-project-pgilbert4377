        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cookie has been made by me the most, not just because it's tasty, but also because it is cheap. As a college student, cheap is good, and using the Betty Crocker Chocolate Chip Mix reduces some of the harder processes of the cookie making since their are only around 4 steps required to finish baking them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this special cookie, you start with taking half of the butter and putting it on a stainless steel pan (yes, the material matters). Take that half of the butter and melt it down and cook it a little until there is a nutty smell and you see brown particles swirling around the butter. Take the browned butter and move to a mixing bowl where brown sugar and vanilla are added and mixed together. Once those are all mixed together, add the rest of the butter, eggs, and cookie mix, and continue to mix until uniform. Next add the flour and extra chocolate chips and mix until the dough looks completed. Size off into small balls and place onto a pan and bake. Once done, let cool and enjoy!</p>
