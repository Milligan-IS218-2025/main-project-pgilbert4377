        <h2>Ingredients for Filling:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Half and Half Cream</li>
            <li>Panko</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that we did was mix all of the ingredients for the dough in a bowl, leaving out the butter at first. Every so often, while kneading the dough, we added a little bit of the butter continuously until all of the butter was used.Once all of the dough was one solid piece, we cut it into 20 pieces, rolled them into small balls, and left them to rise. While the dough was rising, we mixed and kneaded all of the ingredients needed for the filling in a bowl until it was a uniform filling. Whn the dough was ready, we flattened them with a rolling pin and filled them each one by one, by making 20 sausages out of the filling mix and wrapped them dough around the filling as much as possible. Next, we lft them to rise again for a whole hour. Once they had risen, we covered them in a beaten egg, to give a golden look, and baked them in the oven. Once baked, we let them cool, and ate one to make sure the inside cooked all of the way through, and that's all.</p>
